## Installation

1. Format the SD card as **FAT32**: the console supports exFAT, but it is prone to corruption.
2. Put the installer into the root of the SD card and run it there:
   - Linux and macOS: `bash install.sh`
   - Windows: `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File install.ps1`
3. Eject the card safely and insert it into the console.

The installer downloads everything right onto the card: files with the same names are overwritten, the rest of the card stays as it is. GitHub allows 60 anonymous API requests per hour, set `GITHUB_TOKEN` if you run the installer often.

## First boot

{{#modchip}}
Turn the console on: the modchip boots `payload.bin` (Hekate) from the root of the SD card.
{{/modchip}}
{{^modchip}}
1. Turn the console off, slide an RCM jig into the right Joy-Con rail, hold **VOL+** and press **POWER**. The screen stays black: the console is in RCM mode.
2. Connect the console to a computer over USB and inject `hekate_ctcaer_*.bin` from the root of the SD card with TegraRcmGUI on Windows or fusee-launcher on Linux and macOS.
{{/modchip}}

Hekate starts{{#autoboot}} and boots **{{autoboot}}**, hold **VOL-** during the logo to get into the menu{{/autoboot}}.

## emuMMC

Keep the system NAND clean and run CFW from an emuMMC:

1. Create a NAND backup in hekate: **Tools → Backup eMMC**.
2. Create the emuMMC: **emuMMC → Create emuMMC → SD File**. **SD Partition** is faster, but requires **Tools → Partition SD Card** first.
3. Boot **Launch → CFW (emuMMC)**.
